        <h2>Hi. I'm Aasia.</h2>
        
        <h3>
            I'm a recent graduate from Haaga-Helia University Of Applied Science<br />
            and I'm highly interested in penetration testing. <br /> <br />
            I started learning it during summer 2019 with exploring Kali Linux, lab environments and then finally graduating to HackTheBox. <br />
            Since then I have tried to actively learn different concepts and topics, and I currently have 26 machines pwned on HackTheBox. <br /> <br />
            The purpose of this website is to store and showcase the reports I have done for courses and on my free time. <br />
            These can be found in the "Reports" section, if you wish to contact me, my contact information can be found in the "Contact" section.
