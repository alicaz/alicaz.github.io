        <h2>Hi. I'm Aasia.</h2>
        <p>I'm a recent graduate from the university of haaga-helia univesity of appliad science
            and I have focused on specializing in cyber security particularly in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment.
            I have worked on multiple open bug bounty programs and CTFs as a security researcher, to enhance my skills sets
            and widen my understanding on vulnerability types.<br> My interest area include user input vulnerability types, business logic errors,
            and server-side exploits. My strengths lie in problem solving and I love the challenge of being one step ahead of malicious actors.
            This websites includes some reports, write-up, and rechearch areas i have writen about during the past 2 years.
            In the Report section you will find all my writings, and my contact details on the contact section.</p>
