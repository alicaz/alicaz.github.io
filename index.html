        <h2>Hi. I'm Aasia.</h2>
        
        <h3>
            I'm a recent graduate from the university of haaga-helia univesity of appliad science <br />
            and I have focused on specializing in cyber security particularly in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. <br /> <br />
            I have worked on multiple open bug bounty programs and CTFs as a security researcher and to enhance my skills sets <br /> <br /> 
            and widen my understanding on vulnerability types. Which include user input vulnerability types, business logic errors, <br /><br/>
            and server-side exploits. My strengths lie in problem solving and I love the challenge of being one step ahead of malicious actors. <br /><br /> 
            <br />
            This websites includes some reports, write-up, and rechearch areas i have writen about during the past 2 years. <br /><br />
            In the Report section you will find all my writings, and my contact details on the contact section.
