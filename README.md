Hi. I'm Aasia.
       
            I'm a recent graduate from the university of haaga-helia univesity of appliad science
            and I have focused on specializing in cyber security particularly in penetration testing and vulnerability assessment. 
            I have worked on multiple open bug bounty programs and CTFs as a security researcher and to enhance my skills sets 
            and widen my understanding on vulnerability types. Which include user input vulnerability types, business logic errors, 
            
            and server-side exploits. My strengths lie in problem solving and I love the challenge of being one step ahead of malicious actors. 
           
            This websites includes some reports, write-up, and rechearch areas i have writen about during the past 2 years.
            In the Report section you will find all my writings, and my contact details on the contact section.
